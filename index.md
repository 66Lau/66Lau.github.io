Here is **Hang Liu (Lau Hang, 刘航)**.

<!-- I am a senior student majoring in **Automation Engineering** at Xi'an Jiaotong University, Qian Xuesen Honor College. I'm also a visiting student in UC Berkeley during 2023 Fall. I'm now working with **Berkeley Hybrid Robotics Group** , directed by [Dr. Jun Zeng](https://junzengx14.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/). Here is [my CV](https://yihanli126.github.io/file/Yihan_CV.pdf). -->


I am a senior student in Xi'an University of Technology, majoring in **Robotics**, and also is the Deputy Team Leader & Head of the Visual Team of the robot lab **NEXT-E**, advised by Prof. Jun Shang, Prof. Jingyi Wang. My research interest lies at the Robot control algorithm and perception


Here is [my CV](https://66lau.github.io/file/Hangliu_CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

- Robotics 
- Control Theory
- Robot Preception
<br>

Previously, I participated in the RoboMaster 2022 and RoboMaster 2023 robot competitions, where I completed the development of the embedded system for a robot. I also worked on simulating and creating control algorithms for a hybrid jumping robot with both legs and wheels using Webots. Additionally, I designed a robust robot vision tracking system.

Currently, I am responsible for the development of the robot's navigation system in combat scenarios and complex terrains.
