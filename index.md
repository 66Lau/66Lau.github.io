# About Me

<img src="https://66lau.github.io/hangliu.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Hang Liu (Lau Hang, 刘航)**.

<!-- I am a senior student majoring in **Automation Engineering** at Xi'an Jiaotong University, Qian Xuesen Honor College. I'm also a visiting student in UC Berkeley during 2023 Fall. I'm now working with **Berkeley Hybrid Robotics Group** , directed by [Dr. Jun Zeng](https://junzengx14.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Koushil Sreenath](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/koushil/). Here is [my CV](https://yihanli126.github.io/file/Yihan_CV.pdf). -->


I am a senior student in Xi'an University of Technology, majoring in **Robotics**, and also is the Deputy Team Leader & Head of the Visual Team of the robot lab **NEXT-E**, advised by Prof. Jun Shang, Prof. Jingyi Wang. My research interest lies at the Robot control algorithm and perception


Here is [my CV](https://66lau.github.io/file/Hangliu_CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

- Robotics 
- Control Theory
- Robot Preception

<!-- I'm enthusiastic about robotics, and especially interested in **motion planning, optimization and control theory**. My current research lies on model-based trajectory generation and control in automatic drive, including topics like learning based MPC(LMPC), iLQR in iterative manner(i2LQR) and iterative MPPI. I also have experience in real-world development and debugging of intelligent car on real test ground. **I’m willing to get exposed to various topics in the field of robotics motion planning**, including various methodologies like model-based, RL-based methods or their combination and their application on various types of robots like legged and aerial robots. -->


Previously, I participated in the RoboMaster 2022 and RoboMaster 2023 robot competitions, where I completed the development of the embedded system for a robot. I also worked on simulating and creating control algorithms for a hybrid jumping robot with both legs and wheels using Webots. Additionally, I designed a robust robot vision tracking system.


Currently, I am responsible for the development of the robot's navigation system in combat scenarios and complex terrains.


**<font color='red'>[Highlight]</font> I am looking for PhD to start in 2024/2025, RA as well. Contact me if you are interested in my work!**
